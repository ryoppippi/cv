  === Web Development

  I created some websites and web applications. Here are some of them:

  - #styled-link("https://ryoppippi.com")[ryoppippi.com]: My personal website. It is built using `SvelteKit`, `UnoCSS`, and custom `markdown-it` plugins. I wrote all classes by hand. I created this without any AI/LLM tools.
  - #styled-link("https://vim-jp-radio.com/")[Vim-JP Radio LP]: A landing page for a podcast presented by `vim-jp` community.
  - #styled-link("https://pr.ryoppippi.com")[pr.ryoppippi.com]: A personal page to list up my recent OSS contributions.

  === Open Source Projects

  I have started and contributed to many open source projects. Here are some of them:

  ==== AI Tools
  - #styled-link("https://github.com/ryoppippi/ccusage")[ccusage] (#icon("star")7.5k): CLI tool for analysing Claude Code token usage and costs from local JSONL files. Features include daily/monthly/session-based reports, live monitoring, real-time dashboard, model-specific tracking, and cost analysis. Built with TypeScript and designed for incredibly fast and informative insights.
  - #styled-link("https://github.com/ryoppippi/sitemcp")[SiteMCP] (#icon("star")708): Fetch an entire site and use it as an MCP Server. This tool scrapes pages from a website, converts into markdown files, cache them, and serves them as a local MCP server. It is useful when you ask LLMs to ask questions about a libraries/documentation.
  - #styled-link("https://github.com/ryoppippi/curxy")[curxy] (#icon("star")384): Simple proxy worker for using ollama in cursor. If we want to use local LLM models in cursor, we need to have a proxy between local ollama server and remote cursor server. This tool is a simple proxy worker for that.

  ==== Web Development / TypeScript Ecosystem
  - #styled-link("https://github.com/ryoppippi/unplugin-typia")[unplugin-typia] (#icon("star")76): A plugin for bundlers to use `Typia`. `Typia` is a TypeScript validation library which generates logic from TypeScript type. Before this plugin, it was hard to use `Typia` in bundlers like `Vite`, `Webpack`, and `esbuild`. This plugin made a huge impact on the `Typia` ecosystem.
  - #styled-link("https://github.com/ryoppippi/pkg-to-jsr")[pkg-to-jsr] (#icon("star")27): Zero-config tool that generates `jsr.json` from `package.json`. This tool is useful when you publish node projects into `JSR` registry.
  - #styled-link("https://github.com/ryoppippi/mirror-jsr-to-npm")[mirror-jsr-to-npm] (#icon("star")17): A tool designed to mirror packages from `JSR` to `npm`. It is useful when you want to publish your package to both `npm` and `JSR` registries.
  - #styled-link("https://github.com/ryoppippi/vim-svelte-inspector")[vim-svelte-inspector] (#icon("star")19): A plugin for Neovim and `Vim` to integrate with `Svelte Inspector` or `Vue Inspector`. When you click a component on the browser, it opens the corresponding component in your `vim`.
  - #styled-link("https://github.com/ryoppippi/sveltweet")[sveltweet] (#icon("star")6): A Svelte component for embedding tweets. JavaScript is not required, and it supports both SSR and pre-rendering. It enhances the performance of your website.


  ==== Zig
  - #styled-link("https://github.com/ryoppippi/zigcv")[zigcv] (#icon("star")130): Zig bindings for OpenCV. This project is a wrapper for OpenCV in Zig. It is a good example of how to use Zig with C++ libraries.
  - #styled-link("https://github.com/ryoppippi/nyancat.zig")[nyancat.zig] (#icon("star")23): Running `nyancat` in your terminal. Written in Zig.

  === Miscellaneous
  - #styled-link("https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MngEJwk5KPU")["影のキャンバス- Silhouette on Canvas"] - Interactive art installation with projection mapping. Created with `kinect` and `Processing`.
